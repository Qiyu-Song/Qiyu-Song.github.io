I'm interested in **Planetary Atmospheres**. People have been curious about the exotic worlds, including 7 other planets in and over 4,000 planets out of our solar system. Their atmospheric conditions vary in a wide range in planetary orbit, gravity, composition, temperature, pressure and so on. These differences makes many of the known laws for our Earth's atmosphere unvalid, and thus requires people to re-study the atmospheres of these planets from the basic physics laws that can be universally applied.

<br>

Currently I'm most interested in 2 kinds of planets:
* **Gas Giants** (Jupiter, Saturn, etc.) <br>
  These planets' atmosphere is very different from the Earth. A significant and dominant difference is that in these atmospheres condensable species is heavier than back ground molecules (e.g. H<sub>2</sub>O(18g/mol) vs H<sub>2</sub>(2g/mol)). This means parcel with more moisture is denser than a dryer parcel (at same pressure), so that moist convection seems to be suppressed at first glance. But there exist moist convections in such gas giants as we can observe in Jupiter and Saturn. More details about these moist convections ,how they transport heat from interior to space and what parameters might affect this process are to be further explored in these gas worlds.

* **Earth-like Tidally-Locked Planets** (To determine the range of habitable zone)<br>
  Tidally-locked planets - accounting for the majority of terrestrial planets - show the potential to be habitable for creatures if placed in some distances from their stars, so their atmosphere circulations are worth exploring. Previous studies  indicate that strong convection near the sub-stellar area can significantly reflect the sun light, reducing the incoming short-wave radiation and then lower the pace of temperature increasing with closer planet-star distance. A clearer analysis of this effect will re-define the habitable zone for these planets. <br>
