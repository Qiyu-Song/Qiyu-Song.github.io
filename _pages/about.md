I am an Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences at Harvard University. I'm advised by Professor Zhiming Kuang. I'm generally interested in convection processes in the atmosphere, and currently I'm working on data-driven convection parameterization and understanding of convectively coupled equatorial waves. I got my bachelor's degree in atmospheric science at Peking University in 2021.
